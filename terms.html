<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 28.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Terms and Conditions</b></span></h1>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>1 General Provisions</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">1.1 Water Game Studio (collectively,” Calm”, “us”, “our” or “we”) develops and publishes mobile applications (“Games”) that can be downloaded from the App Stores of various providers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">1.2 All Games made by Water Game Studio are provided exclusively on the basis of these General Terms and Conditions. Any general terms and conditions of the user shall expressly not form part of the agreement, even if Water Game Studio does not expressly object to their applicability.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>2 Conclusion of contract, term, termination</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.1 The user confirms to have the full legal capacity and, in the case of restricted legal capacity, to have obtained the consent of his/her legal guardian.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.2 The contract for the use of the Game is concluded by downloading the Game from the respective App Store. Details of this process can be found in the terms of use of the respective App Store. The download creates a contract between the user and Water Game Studio for the free use of the respective Game. The corresponding license and usage agreement on the basis of these General Terms and Conditions is concluded for an indefinite period of time and may be terminated by either party at any time, subject to Section 2.3, without specifying any reasons by providing notice of four weeks.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.3 In addition to the possibility of free use, we also offer additional paid content, e.g. virtual items and power-ups (premium content). The use of the premium content is voluntary and forgoing such use does not restrict other use of the Game. The cost obligation will be indicated separately in the Game. For the acquisition and use of such premium content, the provisions of Section 4 of these General Terms and Conditions, as well as any separate terms and conditions of use of the App Store providers, shall apply in a supplementary fashion. If premium content has a defined duration (e.g. activation of certain premium functions for one month), ordinary termination (also of the contract for free use) shall be excluded during this period. To clarify, ordinary termination shall be possible if the user has purchased premium content without a fixed term (e.g. one-time or permanent power-ups), even if these have effects on the entire further period of use.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.4 It is recommended to always install the latest version of the Game. Water Game Studio is only obligated to provide the full scope of performance and the correct functionality, even of premium content, for the current version of the Game.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.5 In the event of ordinary termination by the user or termination by Water Game Studio for good cause, no reimbursement of paid fees shall take place. We shall be entitled to continue to charge all outstanding fees for premium content already purchased.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.6 The user may not transfer this agreement to third parties. In the event of a breach of this provision (account transfer), We shall be entitled to terminate the agreement without notice, including agreements on premium content. In such event, a prorated refund shall also be excluded.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">2.7 The statutory right to extraordinary termination of this Agreement without notice for good cause shall not be affected.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>3 Account and user data</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">3.1 Upon conclusion of the contract and use of the Game, Water Game Studio shall store the progress of the Game and any additional paid content. For more information, please refer to Water Game Studio’s privacy policy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">3.2 The user must select secure access credentials and not make such data available to third parties. Water Game Studio is not responsible for any damage resulting from the breach of this duty. In the event of suspected abuse, Water Game Studio shall be entitled to temporarily block access to the Game in question.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">3.3 If the user can select a username in the Game, this must not violate applicable laws and/or these General Terms and Conditions. Water Game Studio shall be entitled to change the name in the event of a breach of this provision, either at the instigation of a third party or on its own initiative. No separate justification for the name change shall be necessary. The user has no claim to a specific name. Other rights of Water Game Studio in the event of a breach of this provision shall not be affected.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>4 Premium content</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">4.1 The contract for additional premium content shall only be concluded if the user clicks on the “Pay” or “Order for a fee” button in the shop area of the Game (exact labelling may vary for in-app purchases depending on the App Store). The contract shall be accepted by Water Game Studio (or on its behalf by the respective App Store provider) by sending an order confirmation via message or email, or by actually providing the respective premium content. The fee shall be payable in advance upon acquisition of premium content.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">4.2 A refund after the purchase of premium content can only be made within the scope of statutory consumer rights or the statutory right of revocation with due regard to the respective elements of exclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">4.3 The prices for premium content as displayed via the respective App Stores and transmitted in the order confirmation for the respective order shall apply in each case. These can vary according to currency and country. The prices include any applicable value added tax. Payments will be processed via the respective App Stores. The terms of use and payment of the App Stores shall apply in this regard, supplemented by these General Terms and Conditions. In the event of contradictions between the general terms and conditions of the App Stores and these General Terms and Conditions, the terms of use and payment of the App Stores shall take precedence.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">4.4 If currencies are simulated in the Games (hereinafter, “Premium Points”), these represent premium content or units of measurement for the scope of the license to use the Game in question, and not real money. If such Premium Points can be earned both through Game play and as premium content, the units purchased in return for payment will always be used first when such Premium Points are used. Premium Points may only be converted back into real money if the operation of the Game as a whole is permanently discontinued. In such an event, the fee paid for Premium Points shall be refunded insofar as the corresponding Premium Points have not yet been used to activate Game content.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">4.5 The user shall be responsible for cancellations or chargebacks which the user itself has caused, e.g. due to insufficient account coverage. The user shall normally bear the costs arising therefrom. Water Game Studio shall be entitled to collect these costs together with the original fee from the user’s means of payment. The user shall reserve the right to prove that any damage did not occur or did not occur to the value of the requested amount.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">4.6 If the user defaults on payment, Water Game Studio may, irrespective of the continued obligation to pay, block access to the Game and demand the default interest stipulated by law.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">4.7 Water Game Studio may offer new premium content, change existing premium content and discontinue premium content. Permanent premium content already purchased (virtual items), which are removed from the Game, may in this case be used within a transitional period or exchanged for new premium content. Further claims of the user shall be excluded.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">4.8 For purposes of clarification: All claims of the user with respect to the premium content, particularly with respect to copyrights, warranty for defects and damage compensation, shall be asserted against Water Game Studio (and not against the App Stores).</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>5 User obligations</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5.1 When using the Games, the user may not use any other software or other routines that could interfere with the systems of Water Game Studio or other users. This includes actions that could lead to an unreasonable overloading of the systems of Water Game Studio. The use of special software, particularly for systematic or automatic control of Games, is prohibited.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5.2 The user may not use any software or exploit any programming errors that lead or could lead to obtaining premium content in the Games or other unintended benefits for the user without having concluded a premium agreement, the user thus becoming obliged to pay the fee for such premium content. In the event of unjustified acquisition of premium content, Water Game Studio may delete or deactivate the unjustified premium content or other benefits. For the purposes of clarification: The above shall not apply if premium content can be acquired as a reward for certain Game actions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5.3 In connection with the services of Water Game Studio, the user may not use any software that enables “data mining” or otherwise collects information in connection with the Games.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5.4 The user may not use, buy for real money (except through the App Stores), sell, trade, or attempt to use Premium Content outside the Game.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5.5 When using any communication functions within the Games, the user must comply with all applicable laws and must not infringe the rights of third parties. In addition, certain content is undesirable in the Games because it contradicts the character of the Games as family entertainment media. In concrete terms, this means that users may not:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">use, post or publish any harassing, threatening, disturbing, insulting or defamatory, discriminatory, political, immoral, pornographic, morally reprehensible, offensive, violent, sexist, extreme right-wing or left-wing content or content that glorifies violence or violates laws, particularly laws for the protection of minors, or link to corresponding material on a third party website or advertise, offer or distribute such content or products that violates laws, particularly laws for the protection of minors; and publish, duplicate, make publicly accessible or disseminate content protected for the benefit of third parties without a corresponding license, in particular infringe upon industrial property rights, advertise, offer or distribute goods or services, commit or promote anti-competitive acts, request other users to provide personal data for commercial or illegal purposes or to provide access data, organize or advertise commercial activities and sales of third parties, duplicate an image of another person or make it publicly accessible without the written consent of the person concerned, or publish personal data and confidential data without being entitled to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5.6 Water Game Studio shall be entitled to delete content that violates applicable law and/or these General Terms and Conditions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5.7 The user may only use the Games for private purposes, unless Water Game Studio has given its express prior written consent to any other use in individual cases.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5.8 Any breach of these General Terms and Conditions may lead to termination for good cause. In lieu of such termination, Water Game Studio may, at its sole discretion, announce measures or take sanctioning measures of any kind to enforce the provisions of these General Terms and Conditions. In particular, this shall include declaring a temporary or permanent virtual ban from the systems, warning the user of their temporary or permanent exclusion of the user from individual Game functions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">5.9 Users shall be obligated to regularly back up all their data on the devices on which they use the Games in a manner appropriate to the risk.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>6 Rights, indemnity</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">6.1 Water Game Studio grants the user a non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable right of use for private use with respect to the respective Game for the duration of the contract. This shall include multiple downloads to the device(s) linked to the respective account in the respective App Store. Furthermore, the Game may not be reproduced, distributed, publicly performed, broadcast or made publicly accessible on the Internet or via a network, edited or stored on data carriers. It may also not be used or exploited commercially. In addition, decompilation, disassembly and reverse engineering shall be prohibited, unless expressly permitted by law.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">6.2 If the user sends Water Game Studio feedback, suggestions and/or ideas (collectively referred to as “Feedback”) regarding the Game or possible enhancements or new developments of Games, Water Game Studio may incorporate such Feedback into its Products and/or incorporate such Feedback into the further development of its Products and use such Feedback as part of the Products, or otherwise publish, edit, use and exploit such Feedback. The user grants Water Game Studio, free of charge, the permanent, non-exclusive, spatially unlimited, royalty-free, transferable and sub-licensable right to reproduce, edit, distribute, distribute and make publicly available (in whole and/or in part, and in each case also with respect to adaptations thereof) and otherwise to exploit all Feedback provided by the user. Water Game Studio shall not be obliged to respond to Feedback and/or to use or exploit it. The user waives all possible copyrights in connection with the possible use and exploitation of the Feedback.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">6.3 The user shall indemnify Water Game Studio against all claims, including damage compensation claims, asserted by third parties due to an infringement of their rights by the user’s conduct or the content or data posted. The user shall also be obliged to reimburse the reasonable costs incurred as a result thereof, particularly the costs arising from any legal defense that may be required (including lawyers’ fees customary for the market, which shall not be limited to the statutory fees). This shall not apply if the user is not responsible for the infringement. All further rights and claims of Water Game Studio shall not be affected.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>7 Warranty, liability</b></span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">7.1 Insofar as Water Game Studio provides services free of charge, no warranty claims shall exist and Water Game Studio shall only be liable in accordance with the provisions of law for intentional and gross negligence; Water Game Studio shall only be liable for defects if it has fraudulently concealed them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">7.2 If services are rendered in return for payment, the warranty claims of the user shall be governed by the provisions of law, unless stipulated otherwise in this Section 7.2.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">7.2.1 A warranty shall only be given for the current program version.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">7.2.2 The statutory liability of Water Game Studio for damage compensation and reimbursement of futile expenses shall be unrestricted only in the event of intentional action or gross negligence, in the event of negligent or intentional injury to life, limb or health, due to the assumption of a guarantee (which must be expressly designated as such in order to constitute a guarantee in the legal sense), and due to mandatory liability under the Product Liability Act. “Material contractual duties” shall mean duties whose fulfilment initially enables the achievement of the contractual purpose and on whose compliance the parties may therefore normally rely.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">7.2.3 In events other than those referred to in Section 7.2.2, Water Game Studio shall only be liable for minor negligence in the event of a breach of a material contractual duty. Otherwise, Water Game Studio shall not be liable for minor negligence.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">7.2.4 The damage compensation for the minor negligent breach of material contractual duties in accordance with Section 8.2.3 shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typical in contracts.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">7.3 To the extent Water Game Studio is liable for data loss on the merits in accordance with the foregoing, the amount of such liability shall also be limited to the costs that would have been necessary to restore the data if the user had made reasonable regular data backups.</span></p>
<h2 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>8 Modifications of these General Terms and Conditions</b></span></h2>

These General Terms and Conditions shall then be deemed approved if the user does not object in writing or in text form within four weeks of receiving this information. The time limit for objection and the consequences of silence shall be indicated separately in the notice.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">8.3 Water Game Studio may make the use of an extended version of the Game subject to approval of the modification of these General Terms and Conditions.</span></p>
